# JIRA API Field Highlighter

This repository organizes the versions of the Chrome extension.

- v1.1: first release (tag `v1.1`)
- v1.3: current stable release (branch `main`, tag `v1.3`)
- v1.4: in development (branch `develop`, tag `v1.4`)

How to load in Chrome (developer mode):
1. Open Chrome → Extensions → Manage extensions.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder.

Git strategy:
- `main` = latest stable release (v1.3)
- `develop` = next version under development (v1.4)
- Tags are created for each release
